# 🧠 Rajit’s Data Science Playground  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I dump everything I learn, experiment with, and occasionally break in the world of **Data Science**.  
This repo is basically my notebook — full of messy experiments, statistical curiosities, ML models, and random plots that probably only I find interesting.

## 📚 What’s in here?

Think of this as my **data science backpack** — I keep all sorts of stuff inside:  

- **Statistics** — the math that makes ML make sense. Things like z-scores, p-values, ANOVA, and all that good (and sometimes confusing) stuff.  
- **Machine Learning** — from linear regression that barely works to tree models that overfit in style.  
- **Data Preprocessing** — cleaning data, encoding categories, scaling features, and wondering why half of my dataset is NaN.  
- **Visualization** — where I pretend I’m an artist with Seaborn and Matplotlib. Expect colorful plots and questionable design choices.  
- **Model Evaluation** — bias, variance, VIF, residuals... the part where I realize my model isn’t as smart as I hoped.  
- **Deep Learning** — neural nets, activation functions, optimizers, and experiments that burn my GPU for fun.

## ⚙️ Stuff I Usually Use  

- `numpy` and `pandas` because… obviously  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for plotting pretty lies  
- `scikit-learn` for pretending I understand ML  
- `statsmodels` for feeling statistical  
- `torch` or `tensorflow` when I want my laptop to sound like a jet engine

## 🤓 Why this exists  

Honestly? Because I love having all my data science material in one place —  
somewhere between a portfolio, a diary, and a playground.  
It’s not always clean, but it’s mine — full of notes, mini-projects, and aha moments that helped me understand data better.

## 🎯 Goals  

- Keep learning and documenting everything.  
- Make concepts *click* through experiments.  
- Build intuition, not just memorize formulas.  
- Maybe help someone else who stumbles in here and thinks, “oh, this makes sense now.”

## 🧠 Final Thoughts  

> “Data science is 90% cleaning data, 9% debugging, and 1% actually doing data science.”  

So yeah — if you’re reading this, grab a coffee ☕ and explore around.  
You’ll find a mix of chaos, curiosity, and code.  
Enjoy the mess — that’s where the learning happens.
